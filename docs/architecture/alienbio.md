# ALIEN BIO - Alien Biology Architecture

This is the root architecture document for the Alien Biology system. The architecture is organized into three major subsystems.

## [[infra|Infra]]

Infrastructure layer providing foundational capabilities: entity base classes, serialization, data management, and configuration.

## [[biology|Biology]]

All classes that describe a biological system: molecules, reactions, pathways, systems, organisms, and the generators that create them.

## [[execution|Execution]]

Running simulations and experiments: simulation engine, agent interface, and experimentation framework.
